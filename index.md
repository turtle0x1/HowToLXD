LXD is fantastic product, but its documentation is lacking any clear defined work
flows.

There is so many ways to `develop` & `deploy` with LXD it would be hard work
to document them all, this site aims to put forward some ideas about how to
best utilize LXD in certain situations.

Aiming to cover;

 - Understanding LXD Architecture (WIP)
 - Application Local Development (TODO)
 - Application Production Deployments (TODO)
 - Anything else that comes to mind

This blog / documentation will be split between using [LXD](https://github.com/lxc/lxd)
and **my own** software [LXDMosaic](https://github.com/turtle0x1/LxdMosaic)
